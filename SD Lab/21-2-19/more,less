The command is followed by options (optional of course) and a list of arguments.
 The options can modify the behavior of a command. The arguments may be files or
 directories or some other data on which the command acts. Every command might n
ot need arguments. Some commands work with or without them (e.g. ‘ls’ command).T
he options can be provided in two ways: full word options with -- (e.g. --help),
 or single letter options with - (e.g. -a -b -c or multiple options, -abc).
